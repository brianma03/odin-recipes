                Preheat the grill to 375 degrees F (medium-high).

                In a large bowl, add the beef. Sprinkle evenly with the Worcestershire sauce, seasoning salt, garlic 
                powder, and pepper. Use your hands to mix the ingredients until they are just combined.

                Divide the meat mixture into fourths. Take ¼ of the meat mixture and use your hands to press it into 
                the shape of a hamburger patty that is about ¾ inch thick. Make an indention in the middle of the 
                patty to prevent bulging in the center of the hamburger as it cooks. Repeat with the remaining meat 
                mixture, making 4 hamburgers.
            </p>

                Place the burgers on the grill. Cook 4-5 minutes on the first side. Flip the burgers over and cook 
                an additional 4-5 minutes, until the burgers have reached the desired doneness.

                If adding cheese, lay a slice of cheese on each burger patty about 1 minute before taking the burgers 
                off the grill, so the cheese has a chance to melt.
            </p>
        </li>

            <p>
                Serve the burgers on hamburger buns with optional hamburger toppings.
